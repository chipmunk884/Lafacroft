<h1>About Us</h1>
<!-- TODO: Update with more recent information -->
Lafacroft is a website that is dedicated to the TI-Nspire calculator.  We provide many resources to help you get the best out of your TI-Nspire.  This includes news, a file archive, file submission, and links to many other resources on the internet about the TI-Nspire. 
We strive to keep everything up to date and bug free, but as you may know, nothing is bug free.  Therefore, if something is out of date or has a bug, please email us using the Contact Us form located at the bottom of the page.  You can also use that same page to submit files to our archives, or just give general feedback about the site.  We appreciate any and all feedback that you give.  Ross is very fast at responding to any emails that he receives, so if you send and email to us using the contact form, you will most likely receive a reply that day or sooner.
